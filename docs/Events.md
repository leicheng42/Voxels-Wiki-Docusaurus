## Events

Events in Cryptovoxels are a really fun way to get a group of people together and hang out.

Even if you don't own (or are a collaborator to) parcels, you can still meet up with friends and travel together. If you want to broadcast music to each other, all you have to do is find a [boombox](/docs/features/boombox), and you can cast music to your friend.

### Boombox

Boomboxes are speakers that anyone can broadcast to. Click on a boombox to open this menu

Select the drop down to broadcast from your microphone, or you can use something like [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) or [jackaudio](https://jackaudio.org/) to route your audio to this list of input devices.

The easiest way to stream is to use desktop / tab audio capture in chrome (make sure you click the 'share audio button' when choosing a tab). Launch a youtube tab, then you can stream music from youtube to your group.
