# Username

Your username is the name that will appear above your avatar in-world. It is also the name that will appear on the website once you are logged-in.
Usernames are registered in the $NAME contract on chain and are therefore Non-Fungible tokens.

## How to create a name
From the main Cryptovoxels page, log in with your wallet, then hover over your address on the top right bar and click **Change Name**. You can also just go [here](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/account/names).

Click **Advanced...**

Enter the name you would like to have and press **Register name**. A window should pop-up from your wallet to confirm the transaction. 
Once confirmed, the name will be minted and you should have a notification telling you the minting finished successfully.

:::info
**Your first name will be minted 100% for free, with Cryptovoxels covering the gas fees!** Any additional names created afterwards will have gas fees attached.

:::caution
If your transaction has been refused, it is highly likely that the name you have entered has already been taken or that it does pass the validation test. You can search for your name on OpenSea to see if someone owns it.
:::

:::caution
Make sure it has a maximum length of 16 characters, contains only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, hyphens and underscores.
:::

After a successful transaction, refresh the page and you should see your name popup in the **Switch names** section of the page.

To change your name, click the radio button to the left of the name and it will automatically switch.
You should see your name change on the top right bar as well.

## Troubleshooting
If you get an error when minting your name, changing the Polygon/Matic RPC in your wallet may resolve it.
