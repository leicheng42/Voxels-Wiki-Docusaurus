# 1. Requirements
Wearables live inside a [collection](/docs/Player_customization/Create_a_wearable#h-3-collections), and in order to create a collection, you need to own a [parcel](/docs/Parcels/Buy-a-parcel).
If you don‚Äôt own a parcel, you‚Äôll either need to [submit to a public collection](/docs/Player_customization/Create_a_wearable#submit-to-a-public-collection) or ask someone that owns a parcel to make a collection for you. 
:::caution
You're allowed to create ONE collection PER parcel owned.
:::

You'll also need Matic or ETH (depending on collection) for every transaction.
Lastly, there are community guidelines for the wearables - they can‚Äôt contain offensive racist, discriminatory, violence-endorsing or NSFW content.

# 2. Creating a vox model
## Using MagicaVoxel
To create a vox model, you need [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/). Download the latest version, install it, then open it up.

The first step is to set the size to 32x32x32 - you can do this by selecting the 40s on the top right, typing 32 and hitting enter.

![magica_size.png](/createawearable/magica_size.png)

You are now ready to use MagicaVoxel to create your own hat, snowboard, t-shirt, etc.

:::info
When making your item, the size and rotation are not really important since owners will be able to rescale and rotate the wearable when they want to wear it - [click here to see how users can wear and customize their wearables](/docs/Player_customization/Costume_tab).
:::

## Saving your vox

Once you've made your wearable, save it.

![magica_save.png](/createawearable/magica_save.png)

Make sure the canvas is 32x32x32!

## Uploading your wearable
Your item is created and it is now time to upload it for review!

**You have two choices:**
1. [Mint your wearable to your collection](/docs/Player_customization/Create_a_wearable#minting-a-wearable) (you'll need to [create a collection](/docs/Player_customization/Create_a_wearable#creating-a-collection) first)
1. [Submit your wearable to a public collection](/docs/Player_customization/Create_a_wearable#submit-to-a-public-collection)

The pros of chosing option 2 instead of 1 is that you let someone else manage the collection and that person has to pay the minting fees. 
However, the collection owner is also eligible for royalty fees from OpenSea transactions.

## Tips, scripts & tutorials
MagicaVoxel allows the use of scripts (shaders), has the ability to import certain file types to ease the creation process and can load color palettes, as well as easily create gradients.

### Importing
To import a PNG or JPG, just drag it into MagicaVoxel (clear it beforehand though). You could, for example, import a pixel art face and then extrude it to your liking. If you go this route, you might want to downscale it to 32x32 beforehand (and if you do it in Photoshop, make sure to use Nearest Neighbor for the resample type).

![magica_import_png.gif](/createawearable/magica_import_png.gif)

To import an OBJ, drag it into MagicaVoxel. When you import the file, MagicaVoxel may include a hidden layer, which you‚Äôll have to erase - otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to import your vox into Cryptovoxels. Look at the GIF below to see how to erase.

![magica_import_obj.gif](/createawearable/magica_import_obj.gif)

### Shaders and colors
Shaders go into the shader folder and palettes go into the palette folder. After you've loaded some shaders, they can be accessed either from the right panel or via the console on the bottom. [This site](https://mode-vis.gumroad.com/?sort=newest) offers a lot of different shaders to play with.

![magica_shaders.png](/createawearable/magica_shaders.png)

In order to create gradients, hold CTRL+ALT, then click/hold the starting color and drag it to the ending color.

![magica_gradient.gif](/createawearable/magica_gradient.gif)

### Trying it on before minting
Although there is no official feature to try the wearable on first before minting, you can place the vox in your parcel (or a sandbox parcel) and walk into it to somewhat emulate it.

After dropping the vox in and adjusting the position/scale/rotation, hit C to go into third person and walk into it. It's not perfect, but it works.

![trying_it.gif](/createawearable/trying_it.gif)

Check out the [customization](/docs/Player_customization/Costume_tab) section to see all the ways a player can attach wearables on themselves.

### Having others try it on
If you have the wearable already minted and is in your wallet, you can allow others to try it on before purchasing.

1. Hit *TAB* or click the cubes near the top right
1. Select **Collectible Model** and place it in your parcel
1. Select the wearable under **Your Collectibles**
1. Check the **Allow parcel visitors to try on collectible** checkbox
1. Select the **Bone**
1. Adjust the **position** / **rotation** / **scale**
1. Test it out to ensure you look good

![trying_it2.gif](/createawearable/trying_it2.gif)

### Glitched face
[Stella](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/avatar/0xf1182c5e5bcd7c90b04eb14eb4f971c52f510d47) figured out a way to make awesome glitched out wearables in Cryptovoxels. üò∏
![glitchedface.gif](/createawearable/glitchedface.gif)
To replicate this crazy effect, check out the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frn3JCyWHY4)!

### Flat wearable
If you're planning on making a flat or thin wearable, you will have to create it a certain way in MagicaVoxel, otherwise scaling might look off. Below you can see three different VOXes that appear similar, but when scaled, one of them is clearly off (and moves as a result).

![flat3.gif](/createawearable/flat3.gif)

To make sure your flat wearable doesn't look funky while scaled, either make it on the "ground", or have it at the center point as shown below (which is y:15).

![flat.png](/createawearable/flat.png)

# 3. Collections
A collection is a group of 3D NFTs that are spawnable in-world or wearable.

Having your collection created and whitelisted in cryptovoxels means you can create your own brand of collectibles (in this case wearables) based on the blockchain.

You can have players wear or place the collectibles of that collection in-world. They will also be able to find your collection and collectibles on the Cryptovoxels website and OpenSea. You'll also be able to manage aspects of your collection from Cryptovoxels & OpenSea.

:::caution
You're allowed one collection per parcel owned. If you do not own a parcel, you will have to submit to a public collection. 
The size of the parcel owned does NOT dictate the amount of wearables you can have in a collection.

:::

## Minting a wearable
Now you're ready to mint! Head to your collection page and make sure you‚Äôre signed in (it‚Äôll be something like https://www.cryptovoxels.com/collections/1). 
If you're submitting to a public collection, skip the next section.

:::caution
Plan on minting shoes or something that requires the user to own two of them? Keep in mind that **users will need to own two of your wearables then** (meaning you may have to mint double the amount). This change was made around November 2021.
:::

### Polygon/Matic RPC
To ensure stability, we recommend switching your wallet's RPC for Polygon/Matic to https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/.

![rpc.png](/createawearable/rpc.png)

### Submit to a public collection
If you don‚Äôt own a Parcel, you can always submit to a public collection.

1. Head over to https://www.cryptovoxels.com/collections
1. Click the **Available to public** checkbox
1. Select a collection
1. Click the **üè≠Submit** button

![public_collection.png](/createawearable/public_collection.png)

5. Read the warnings, fill out the info and click the checkbox on the bottom, then click the **Submit** button

7. Once the wearable is minted by the collection owner, you‚Äôll get a message on Cryptovoxels (you‚Äôll see a red dot next to **Inbox** on the top if you get it)

## Trading a wearable
You can transfer wearables either on the Cryptovoxels website or on OpenSea.

### Trading on Cryptovoxels
To transfer using the Cryptovoxels website, head to the wearable you want to send [e.g. https://www.cryptovoxels.com/collections/1/1] and click the Transfer button on the bottom. If you don‚Äôt see the Transfer button, it either means you need to switch networks on your wallet or that you do not possess any amount of that wearable.

![transfer_wearable.png](/createawearable/transfer_wearable.png)

A dialog will pop up asking who to transfer to and how many. Fill that out and hit the Transfer button.

![transfer_to_who.png](/createawearable/transfer_to_who.png)

It‚Äôll then ask to confirm the address - if it looks good, click the **OK** button. Your wallet will pop-up asking to confirm the transaction (Matic or ETH gas), click the **Confirm** button to continue. A dialog will show the transfer in process and then close.

### Trading on OpenSea
If you‚Äôd prefer to send it over OpenSea, you can do so as well. Head to the wearable on OpenSea and click the Transfer button located on the top right.

![transfer_opensea.png](/createawearable/transfer_opensea.png)

If you don't see the transfer button, make sure you're logged in.

## Selling on OpenSea

If you want to sell your wearable, you‚Äôll have to price it on OpenSea. Go to an item in your collection on the Cryptovoxels page, then hit the **Buy Now** button.

![selling_wearable.png](/createawearable/selling_wearable.png)

:::caution
On your listing in OpenSea, if you DO NOT see your wearable rotating around, you may have to click the **Refresh metadata** button. If it‚Äôs still not visible after waiting a minute, you may have to report this as a bug on the Cryptovoxel‚Äôs forum, or possibly wait a little longer.
:::

You should now be on the OpenSea page with your wearable rotating around. Click the Sell button.

![sell_wearable2.png](/createawearable/sell_wearable2.png)

Keep in mind - after your wearable is posted for sale, the Sell button shifts downward, under *Listings*.

![sell_wearable3.png](/createawearable/sell_wearable3.png)

The *Sell your item* dialog will pop-up after hitting the **Sell** button. Put the amount, in ETH, for how much you‚Äôre going to sell your wearable for. Keep in mind OpenSea will take 2.5%. There may also be royalty fees involved too, but you shouldn‚Äôt see that now.

You can also set an end date to the sale, in case you want it listed for a limited time. If you want, click **Schedule listing** and set the end date.

![sell_item.png](/createawearable/sell_item.png)

Click the **Complete listing** button when ready and your wearable will be listed for sale.

:::caution
For Matic/Polygon collections, the ETH you receive will be PoS-WETH. If you don't see it on your wallet, switch networks or go [here](https://wallet.polygon.technology/wallet).
:::

## Customization & royalties
You can customize your collection on Cryptovoxels & on OpenSea. You'll also be able to set up royalties for your collection.

### Customizing your collection in Cryptovoxels
Go to your collection page and click the **‚öôAdmin** button.

Under *Settings* you get the ability to change your **Collection Name**, **Description**, **Cover Color** and **Logo**. 

![customize_collection1.png](/createawearable/customize_collection1.png)

Under *Social and interactions* you can add your **Twitter handle**, **OpenSea store**, **In-world store** (if you own a parcel, enter the ID) and **Featured collectible** (enter the ID of the wearable). If you enter this all, you‚Äôll see your Twitter feed and featured collectible on the right hand side on the collection page and two new buttons (**View on Opensea** & **Visit store**) will show.

![customize_collection2.png](/createawearable/customize_collection2.png)

### Customizing your collection in OpenSea
Before we start customizing on OpenSea, we have to let them know you are the actual owner, which won't be instantaneous. Copy the address from your collection‚Äôs Admin page.

![customize_opensea1.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea1.png)

On OpenSea go to the [Collection Manager](https://opensea.io/collections), click the **kebab menu** and select **Import an existing smart contract**.

![customize_opensea2.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea2.png)

Click the first button, **Live on a mainnet**, then click the dropdown on the left, select Polygon (for Matic) or ETH, enter your address and click the **Submit** button.

![customize_opensea3.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea3.png)

Once submitted, you have to wait until someone manually connects the collection to your account. You‚Äôll know if you are connected once you are able to edit your collection on the [Collection Manager](https://opensea.io/collections) page.

![customize_opensea4.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea4.png)

Once your account is connected, you‚Äôll be able to edit your collection information, including adding a Logo image, Featured image & Banner image.

![customize_opensea6.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea6.png)

If you scroll down you‚Äôll get to the Royalites section. From here, you can put up to 10% for the fee and enter your payout wallet address.

![customize_opensea5.png](/createawearable/customize_opensea5.png)

Have fun customizing your collection!

## Wearable attributes
You can add up to three attributes to your wearables. This is optional but useful and fun.

### Setting up attributes

Go to your collection page and click the **‚öôAdmin** button, scroll down and go to the *Custom Attributes* section, then click **Add a trait**.

![attributes1.png](/createawearable/attributes1.png)

Click the dropdown menu and select the [type](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#section-attributes).

![attributes2.png](/createawearable/attributes2.png)

Once you have your attribute(s) set up, click **Save changes**.

![attributes3.png](/createawearable/attributes3.png)

### Applying attributes to existing wearables

After custom attributes are set in the collection, attributes can be added to existing wearables.
Go to the wearable‚Äôs page on Cryptovoxels and scroll down, then add the info and hit the **Save Attribute** button.

![attributes4.png](/createawearable/attributes4.png)

:::caution
If you do not want to use one of the attributes for the wearable, click the **Ignore** checkbox in the attribute box.
:::

### Applying attributes to new wearables
After custom attributes are set in the collection, attributes can be added during the wearable upload process.

![attributes5.png](/createawearable/attributes5.png)

### What it looks like on OpenSea
Below you can see how it looks like on OpenSea. The **AUTHOR**, **RARITY** & **VOX** Properties were automatically inputted by Cryptovoxels and **TYPE** was manually added by an attribute. Under Stats you can see the **#** & **Generation** that was manually added as well.

![attributes6.png](/createawearable/attributes6.png)

The other benefit of adding attributes is helping people filter and sort through your collection.

![attributes7.png](/createawearable/attributes7.png)

## Rarity levels
The number of issues of your wearable will dictate its rarity.

**Common** = Greater or equal to 1000 issues
**Rare** = Greater or equal to 100 issues and smaller than 1000
**Epic** = Greater or equal to 10 issues and smaller than 100
**Legendary** = Greater or equal to 1 issues and smaller than 10
