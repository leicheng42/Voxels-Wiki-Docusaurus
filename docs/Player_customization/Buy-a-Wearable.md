:::caution
Watch out for the quantity and the price. Sometimes items can be sold in other currencies than **Îž**.
:::

At that moment a Metamask window should popup asking you to confirm the transaction.

**You should know:**
- When buying a wearable, you have to pay for transaction fees, so watch your total balance!

## 3. Wear it

To wear your wearable, you can go to your [Costumer](/docs/Player_customization/Costume_tab).
