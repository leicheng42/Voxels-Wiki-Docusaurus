![labels.png](/parcels/labels.png)

## Parcel snapshots
Snapshots are user-selected states of your Parcel that you can chose to come back to later.
Use this to backup (take snapshot) & restore (revert) your Parcel during major changes or to swap your Parcel around for events.

If you prefer to work with snapshots within Cryptovoxels itself, you can! Click [here](/docs/Parcels/Building#parcel-snapshots) to learn how.

### See available snapshots
You can also view the list of snapshots and revert to a different state from your Parcel's page.
(e.g. https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1)

![parcel-admin.png](/building/parcel-admin.png)

### Taking a snapshot
On the *Snapshots* page of your parcel (e.g. https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1/snapshots), click **Take snapshot**.

![snapshot-take.png](/parcels/snapshot-take.png)

### Restoring a snapshot
On the *Snapshots* page of your parcel, click **Revert to snapshot** on the snapshot you want to revert to.

![snapshot-revert-b.png](/parcels/snapshot-revert-b.png)

![json-download.png](/parcels/json-download.png)

You can restore your parcel by loading the JSON back.
In *Parcel version management*, under *Import* on the right side, click the **Choose File** button and select the JSON file.

![json-restore.png](/parcels/json-restore.png)

:::caution

:::

:::caution
**Validation rules:**
Features outside parcel feature bounds will be removed.
Imported parcel/space should be of the same size as the in-world parcel.
Features have to have valid types and valid data.
:::

## Parcel to space
[Spaces](/docs/Spaces) are free plots of land off-grid that are building volumes similar to parcels and are an excellent way to experiment.
Head over [here](/docs/Spaces#converting-parcel-to-space) to learn how to convert your parcel to a space.

## Space to parcel
You can convert a space to a parcel, as long as the dimensions are the same.
Head over [here](/docs/Spaces#converting-space-to-parcel) to learn how.

## Danger zone
You can clear all the history of the parcel via the *Danger zone*.
This is useful if you're selling your parcel and you don't want the new owner to have access to your work, or if you want to clean up your history.

Scroll down and click the **Clear parcel history** button to erase your parcel history.

![danger-zone.png](/building/danger-zone.png)

:::caution
Clicking **Clear parcel history** will completely delete all non-snapshot versions of your parcel.
This process cannot be reversed - once cleared, there is no way to get the history back.
