# Creating a new Collection
Deploy a contract on matic to mint and sell your wearables / furniture

## Getting onto Matic


### 0. Get metamask

You need it. [Install it](https://metamask.io/).

### 0.5. Buy some $MATIC

You need a little bit of MATIC to deploy contracts on the matic network. [Buy like $5 of matic](https://wallet.matic.network/).

### 1. Add matic support to metamask

[Follow these instructions](https://medium.com/@quickswap.layer2/guide-how-to-set-up-custom-matic-mainnet-rpc-for-metamask-transfer-assets-from-l1-to-l2-to-use-3b1e55ccb5cb) to set up Matic as a network in your metamask. You can then switch between the Ethereum mainnet and Matic network whenever you need.
