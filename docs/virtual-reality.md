VR Support for Cryptovoxels

## Virtual Reality

Cryptovoxels has Virtual Reality support. You need to use a VR compatible browser, and it's all a bit basic at the moment, but you can explore. We're working on making it better.

### Headsets

The quest just works with the built in browser, the other headsets only work well on Windows, using either Internet Explorer or Firefox.

##### Windows Mixed Reality:

* Use latest Internet Explorer Edge.

##### Oculus Quest:

* Use built in Oculus browser

##### Oculus Rift:

* Use Chrome 85+ with OpenXR

See [this issue](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples/issues/43#issuecomment-686045492) for info. It looks like a total pain in the ass, but I assume it works.

##### HTC Vive:

* Use Chrome 85+ with OpenXR

See [github issue](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-samples/issues/43#issuecomment-686045492) for info.
