## Submit to the Asset library
Since version 8 we can now share our features (not just vox models!) to anybody in-world via the asset library.


To submit to the asset library simply place a feature down and edit it however you want.

Then, in the editor of that feature you will find `Add to library` in the top bar.

Upon click, a screenshot will be taken and the asset will be shared to the public:
