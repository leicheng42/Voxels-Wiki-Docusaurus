Cryotovoxels parcels and units

## Parcels and units
Parcels and units are buildable volumes that are purchasable by users. To purchase a plot, you can go to [Opensea](https://opensea.io/assets/cryptovoxels) or [tokentrove](https://tokentrove.com/Cryptovoxels).

Note: to purchase a parcel you will need a [metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet.

#### Parcels
Parcels, or plots, are buildable volumes that are at ground level.

#### Units
Units are appartments and tend not to be at ground level. In other words, units are usually in a tower. For instance, 506 Neutron tower (https://cryptovoxels.com/parcels/3529) is a unit.

#### Commons
Parcels labelled as "cryptovoxels commons" belong to the Cryptovoxels corporation and are not purchasable. These parcels tend to serve as space to build stairs or elevators.

All types of land have the same building rights.
