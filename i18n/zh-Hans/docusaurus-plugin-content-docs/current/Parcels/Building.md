In Cryptovoxels you can place voxels (blocks) similar to Minecraft.

![building-intro.gif](/building/building-intro.gif)

You can also use a [Megavox](/docs/features/megavox) as the building structure, [animate objects](/docs/Scripting/Animation-API), use [scripting](/docs/Scripting/) and [more](/docs/features) with your Parcel too.

# Where can you build?
- In a Parcel that you [own](/docs/Parcels/Buy-a-parcel)
- In a Parcel that you're a collaborator on
- In a sandbox Parcel
- In a free [Space](/docs/Spaces)

# Building tools (sidebar)
Once inside or around a Parcel you can build on, tools will slide in on the right side.

![build-sidebar.png](/building/build-sidebar.png)

**Add** - Use this to add new content to the Parcel, like voxels or features
**Edit** - Use this to edit, replicate or move features, or customize voxel textures and tints
**Snapshots** - Save and load states of the Parcel, used as a backup feature or to change the structure
**Parcel Features** - List of features in the parcel sorted by proximity

# Voxels (blocks)
Each Parcel has a maximum amount of blocks that can be placed, and is listed on the [Parcel's page](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1).

![parcel-info.png](/building/parcel-info.png)

Once inside or around a Parcel you can build on, you can open the *Add menu* by pressing **TAB** or clicking the **Add button** on the right.
The parcel should be highlighted and the *Add menu* should pop up.

## Cube (texturable)
![blocks-cube.gif](/building/blocks-cube.gif)
A [Cube](/docs/features/cube) is not actually a voxel, but a [feature](/docs/Parcels/building_temp#features) - which means you place it and modify it like a feature.
This means that the build/paint/erase tools used for other blocks do not work on these.
### What makes the Cube different?
- You can pull images from the web or womps and use as the texture
- You can toggle collision (if off, avatars can walk through it)
- Tints and textures can be different per every Cube used
- You can add a feature ID to it for scripting
- You can add a script to it
- You can rotate a Cube
- You can resize a Cube

# Features
Ranging from [NFTs](/docs/features/nft-image) to [VOX models](/docs/features/vox-model), features play a very important role in your Parcel or Space.
For the complete list of features, go [here](/docs/features).

## Placing a feature
In a Parcel/Space you own or have collaboration access to, open the *Add menu*.
Select a feature from the list, move it to where you want it, and **click** to place it.

![features-placing.gif](/building/features-placing.gif)

:::caution
There is a limit to how many features can be in a Parcel or Space. Look at the Add Menu for more information.
:::

## Editing a feature
Each feature has its own parameters you can adjust.
**Right click** (or hit <kbd>e</kbd> and **click**) the feature to edit it, then make any adjustments you need to make. You can also find & edit the feature via [Parcel Features](/docs/Parcels/building_temp#parcel-features-menu).

![features-editing.gif](/building/features-editing.gif)

## Replicating a feature
**Right click** the feature and click the **Replicate** button, then **click** where you want the replicated feature to be.
You can also hit <kbd>R</kbd>, then **click** the feature, move the cursor and **click** where you want to replicate it.

## Asset library
There is a library of user-generated content that you can pull from. 
To see what's available, open the *Add menu* and click **Browse Asset Library**.

# Parcel Features menu
The Parcel Features menu is a list of all features currently placed in your Parcel, **sorted by proximity**.
This is an extremely useful tool when your parcel gets filled with features!

![parcel-features.gif](/building/parcel-features.gif)

You can also erase or group features by clicking the checkboxes next to the features and clicking the buttons below.
For more information on grouping features, go [here](/docs/features/group).

# Parcel Snapshots
Snapshots are user-selected states of your Parcel that you can chose to come back to later.
Use this to backup (take snapshot) & restore (revert) your Parcel during major changes or to swap your Parcel around for events.

![parcel-snapshots.gif](/building/parcel-snapshots.gif)

You can also view the list of snapshots and revert to a different state from your Parcel's page.
(e.g. https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/1)
