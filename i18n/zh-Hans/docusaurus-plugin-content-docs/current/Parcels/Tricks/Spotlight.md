## Spotlight effect
![spotlight_example.png](/spotlight_example.png)

**Step one**
Download [this gradient](https://i.imgur.com/xyXO4op.png) for a white light effect or [this gradient](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dbs78no00a0lkga/red%20gradient.png?dl=0) for a red light effect.

Or to achieve this effect on your own, you will need an advanced image editor such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (open-source) or [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/nz/products/photoshop.html), and create a linear gradient. 
For a white light effect, it is recommended to create a black and white gradient. Whereas for a colored light effect, you have to create a white and *color* gradient.

**Step two**
Upload your work on a server. Free image hosts include [CV Discord](https://discord.gg/rQVMQax) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).

**Step three**
Insert your image in-world using the image feature.
If you want a white effect light, use the `screen` option in `Blend mode`.

**Step four**
Resize, reposition and scale the image as you desire.
