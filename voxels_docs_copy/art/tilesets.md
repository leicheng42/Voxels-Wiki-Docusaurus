# Tileset bounties

Tilesets are composed of 16 512x512 pngs. These are used as the textures for the voxel field that you build in voxels.

There are currently bounties for the following island tilesets:

 * [Future](future) - closes August 31st - dark, cyberpunk, neon lit, dense, exciting, robots
 * [Anhedonia](anhedonia) - Closes September 8th - grey, nihilist, empty, monochrome, windswept, brutalist
 
### Process:

To test and build your tileset, create a free space and upload your tiles into the tile editor. Build a nice example build to show off your tiles.

 * Stake your claim to build an island tileset by posting a comment below `i YOURNAME am making a tileset for future`
 * Post a screenshot, and a link to your space and the message `i YOURNAME agree to the voxels art contributor license agreement`
 * We will review the comments and close entries upon selecting an entry
 
 Any entries that are not accepted for voxels retain the complete works of the author and may be remixed or resubmitted for a future bounty.
 
### Acceptance:

Upon your tileset being accepted, your tileset is transferred to voxels and you will recieve a parcel of our choosing. Full terms to be provided...
